However as the market for fruits became scarce, members decided to go multipurpose right from 2018 and the cooperative is engaged in multiple businesses but majorly in the production of selected crops such as Sorghum, Rice, Soya beans, Maize, Sunflower, groundnuts, cassava, millet to mention but few.
